## Packages
recharts | For visualizing program outcome analytics and survey results
framer-motion | For smooth page transitions and UI animations
lucide-react | Beautiful icons for the UI
date-fns | For formatting dates

## Notes
- Auth is handled via Replit Auth (use-auth.ts hook already exists)
- Role-based access control needs to be implemented in the layout/routing
- Survey forms need to handle dynamic questions (scale/text)
